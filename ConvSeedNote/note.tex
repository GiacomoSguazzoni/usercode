Nonetheless this unavoidable detector effect can bealso extremely useful. The reconstruction of photon conversion can beused to probe the detector material and to accurately measure softphotons that come from radiative decays in heavy flavor physics. Infact a converted photon can be measured with very high momentumresolution by exploiting the excellent reconstruction of chargedtracks of a tracking detector as the one of CMS at LHC.The main issue is that photon conversions tracks are difficult toreconstruct for standard reconstruction algorithm. They are typicallysoft and very displaced from primary interaction vertex.An innovative seeding technique that exploits the peculiar photonconversion topology is described. It has been successfully applied inthe CMS track reconstruction sequence within CMSSW. The performancesof this technique and the substantial enhance of photon conversion reconstruction efficiency are discussed.In the note also other potential techniques for photon conversionseeding are presented.  \end{abstract}%\note{Preliminary version}\end{titlepage}\setcounter{page}{2}%JPP%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Begin text %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\include{introduction}\include{standard}\include{singleleg}\include{otherseed}\include{conclusions}\include{bibliography}\end{document}
