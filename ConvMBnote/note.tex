The numberof photon conversions counted in a volume can be translated into amaterial budget estimate for that volume once the shape and positionof the volume, the impinging photon flux and the conversionreconstruction efficiencies are correctly taken into consideration. Thedetailed accounting of all this issues is given and some preliminaryresults based on $900\GeV$ late 2009 data are shown.  \end{abstract}%\note{Preliminary version}\end{titlepage}\setcounter{page}{2}%JPP%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Begin text %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\include{introduction}\include{sample}\include{dataVsMc}\include{correctionFactors}\include{results}%\include{unfolding}\include{conclusions}\include{bibliography}\end{document}
