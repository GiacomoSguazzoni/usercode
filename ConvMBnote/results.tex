\section{Results}

The conversion counting in a given volume can be translated into a material budget estimate once the efficiency and the impinging 
photon flux are correctly taken into account. 
In particular, assuming a negligible background, the number of reconstructed photon conversion $N_{\rm reco}$ in a given volume bin is
\begin{equation}
N_{\rm reco} \propto \varepsilon \cdot \langle \frac{P}{X_0} \rangle \cdot f_{\rm geom}
\end{equation}
where $\varepsilon$ is the reconstruction efficiency and $\langle P/{X_0} \rangle$ is the average conversion probability ($P\sim 7/9$).

The present statistics allow only the pixel barrel to be studied. 
It is identified by choosing the following fiducial volume: $|z|<26~{\rm cm}$ and $r<15~{\rm cm}$.
Such region is divided for convenience in four parts, corresponding to the beam pipe and the three pixel barrel layers:\\
$1~{\rm cm}<r_{\rm BP}<3.5~{\rm cm}<r_{\rm PXL1}<6~{\rm cm}<r_{\rm PXL2}<8.4~{\rm cm}<r_{\rm PXL3}<15~{\rm cm}$. \\
The conversion finding efficiency $\varepsilon$, estimated from MC data for each sub-region, is 2.8\%, 3.5\%, 0.5\% and 0.1\% respectively.

Fig.~\ref{figMBvsr} represents an uncalibrated estimation, given in arbitrary units, 
comparing the material budget of the beam pipe and of the pixel barrel layers as a function of the radius $r$.
The correction factor $f^{r, z}_{\rm geom}$ is given by Eq.~\ref{eq:13}.
The green line shows the case of ideal resolution and efficiency, corrected for $f_{\rm geom}$.
Blue boxes represent MC pseudo data and black dots data; they are both corrected for $\varepsilon$ and $f_{\rm geom}$.
The conversion radius in data is computed with respect to the pixel center $(-0.1475\cm, -0.3782\cm, -0.4847\cm)$, 
as estimated from tracker alignment algorithms. 
The expected fake contribution, shown in red boxes, is not subtracted. 
Data show a good agreement with MC, both in shapes and in the overall number of entries.
The third pixel layer bin is dominated by statistical fluctuations and the high background contribution.

Fig.~\ref{xyPlot} and Fig.~\ref{zrPlot} show the comparison in the $x$$-$$y$ and $z$$-$$r$ planes respectively, where the grey density 
gives an estimate of the amount of material in bins of size $0.25~cm\times0.25~cm$. 
The material in the $x$$-$$y$ plane is computed using the correction factor $f^{x, y}_{\rm geom}$ defined in Eq.~\ref{eq:15}.
The low statistics of reconstructed photon conversions does not allow a quantitative comparison of the results from data yet.
