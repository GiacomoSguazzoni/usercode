\section{Analysed Samples}
\label{sample}

Results shown in this note have been obtained with the release {\tt 3\_3\_6\_patch3} of {\tt CMSSW}.

Data sample corresponds to the dataset\\
{\tt /MinimumBias/BeamCommissioning09-BSCNOBEAMHALO-Dec19thSkim\_336p3\_v1/RAW-RECO}.\\
The list of analyzed runs and lumisections is taken from the table recommended by the Tracker 
DPG\footnote{https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMSTKPOGCollisions900GeVDec\#Run\_and\_LumiSection\_selections},
i.e. all runs at $900\GeV$ with detector in stable conditions and magnet fully operational. 
Runs at $\sqrt{s}=2.36\TeV$ are not included.

As far as Monte Carlo simulation is concerned, a sample of $\sim11$M events of minimum bias at $900\GeV$ is used; this sample features a displaced beam spot reproducing the actual beam spot position as observed in collision data. In particular the dataset is:\\
{\tt /MinBias/Summer09-STARTUP3X\_V8K\_900GeV-v1/GEN-SIM-RECO}.

Events are selected with the following requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item Trigger: bits 0 and 40, plus a veto of beam-halo triggers (bits 36-39); in MC events only bit 40 is required;
\item beam scraping events are rejected requiring a fraction of tracks with \emph{highPurity} quality label greater than 20\%;
\item a {\em good} reconstructed primary vertex is required; a reconstructed primary vertex is defined as good if it originates at least four tracks and if its position lies within $15\cm$ in the longitudinal 
direction and within $2\cm$ in the transverse plane.
\end{itemize}

The results shown in this note are normalized to the number of events surviving the above described selection; in particular 257,526 for data and 6,142,518 for MC, thus the weight applied to MC entries is $4.2\cdot 10^{-2}$.
