\section{Introduction}

The description of the CMS Tracker~\cite{cmspaper} geometry included in the CMS software
framework~\cite{CMSSW} to simulate and reconstruct the events includes the
state-of-the-art knowledge of the passive materials through a set of XML files
then appropriately interfaced with GEANT4~\cite{g4}, the detector simulation package used in CMS.
%collected in the packages {\tt Geometry/CMSCommonData} and {\tt
%  Geometry/TrackerCommonData}.

The relevant quantity for determining the
impact of the Tracker material on the reconstruction performance is the
thickness, either in units of radiation length $\Xo$, or in units of 
interaction length $\lI$, crossed by a particle produced at the
nominal interaction point which coincides with the nominal center of the Tracker.
These thicknesses, referred in the following as $\TX$ and $\TI$ respectively,  
are evaluated simulating a sample of 100,000
neutrinos generated at the center of the Tracker, with a uniform
distribution in $-5\le\eta\le5$ and $0\le\phi\le2\pi$. The unperturbed
trajectory throughout the Tracker volumes can thus be followed, and the
distributions of $\TX$ and $\TI$ as a function of $\eta$ produced. 
The distributions of $\TX$ and $\TI$ of the Tracker drop at about $|\eta|$=3.7.
The $\eta$ range considered in the following analysis will be 
$-3\le\eta\le3$ where the average thicknesses determined with the procedure
described above are  $\TX=1.184\pm0.002$ and $\TI=0.3495\pm0.0006$.

The Tracker geometry used by the detector simulation has been deployed by using at best the techical informations, engineering designs, and direct experience of the people contributing to its construction and assembly.
%material budget description. 
However there are known issues with this description:
\begin{itemize}
\item residual discrepancies between simulated and weighted masses; 
\item unavoidable approximations with respect to the actual geometry of the physical volumes and of the material distribution and composition.
\end{itemize}

This note will discuss a possible way to estimate the uncertainty related to the former of these issues. Nevertheless the conservative approach choosen allows the results to give also reasonable insigths on systematic uncertainties related to the latter effect.

The quantitative inputs of the study are the simulated versus weighted mass discrepancies, $\DM$'s, when available. Nevertheless, the impact of $\DM$ on the total thickness in terms of number of radiation lengths, $\TX$, or in terms of number of interaction lengths, $\TI$, does depend on how the $\DM$ is distributed among the various Tracker components and materials. Once this dependence is known, it has been fed with $\DM$'s, but also with any other input useful to understand downstream effects on $\TX$ or $\TI$.

\section{Method}

As sketched in Fig.~\ref{fig:can}, the total thickness in units of radiation lengths, $\TX$, has the following dependence on the $N$ materials:
\begin{equation}
\TX = \sum^N_i \rho_i \frac{\ell_i}{\Xo_i} \equiv \sum_i \tX_i.
\end{equation}
Similarly the total thickness in units of radiation lengths, $\TI$, is
\begin{equation}
\TI = \sum^N_i \rho_i \frac{\ell_i}{\lI_i} \equiv \sum_i \tI_i.
\end{equation}
In the above relations, $\rho_i$ is the density, $\ell_i$ the thickness of the $i$-th material and $\Xo_i$ and $\lI_i$ the radiation length and the interaction length, respectively, expressed in $\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^2$.

\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{fig/can.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Sketch of a simplified cylindrical volume made up of three different materials.}
\label{fig:can}
\end{figure}

The proposed method to investigate the impact on the detector performance of residual discrepancies $\DM$'s consists in changing in an appropriate and controlled way the material components by using a set of k-factors $\kvect\equiv(k_1, ..., k_i, ..., k_N)$ and then studying the effects on $\TX$ and $\TI$, e.g.:
\begin{equation}
\TX = \sum^N_i \rho_i \frac{\ell_i}{\Xo_i} \rightarrow  \TX(\kvect) = \sum^N_i k_i \rho_i \frac{\ell_i}{\Xo_i},
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\TI = \sum^N_i \rho_i \frac{\ell_i}{\lI_i} \rightarrow  \TI(\kvect) = \sum^N_i k_i \rho_i \frac{\ell_i}{\lI_i}.
\end{equation}

%\section{Parser}

In GEANT4 the {\em logical volume} is a solid filled with a given material, either a pure element or a compound of elements or other materials. A detector geometry in GEANT4, and the CMS Tracker makes no exception, is build up by logical volumes placed in the space ({\em physical volumes}) in one or more replicas. Logical volumes as well materials are generally organized hierarchically.

On a very complex GEANT4 detector description as the one of the CMS Tracker, the method above described can only be practically implemented by leaving the solid dimensions unchanged and modifying the densities of the materials associated to solids, i.e. $k_i \rho_i \ell_i \equiv (\rho_i + \Delta \rho_i) \ell_i$. Within CMSSW this is done by altering the XML files used to describe the detector geometry. A software tool written consisting of a perl XML parser has been developed on purpose. The material XML files in input are parsed and then, according to a {\em scenario} configuration, the effective densities of the material under study and of all materials that depend on it (directly and indirectly) are changed; finally the modified XML files are written in output. These modified XML files are fully working in CMSSW and actually represent a CMS Tracker with some of its material components altered with respect to the nominal description.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%The detailed modification procedure is the following:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item the density attribute is modified according to the k-factors in the tags {\tt <ElementaryMaterial .../>} or {\tt <CompositeMaterial .../>} where the materials are defined;
%\item all composite materials that depend on the modified materials are accordingly modified; if the composite material has density $\rho$ and fractions $w_j$, $j$ being the index running over the components, the parser apply the following substitutions:
%\begin{equation}
%w_j \to \frac{k_jw_j}{\sum kw}, \,\,\,\,\, \rho \to \rho \sum kw;
%\end{equation}
%\item step b) is repeated recursively with a scaling factor $1/\sum kw$ for all materials modified in the step b).
%\end{enumerate}
%
%The parser is accessible via CVS in ...
%
%The parser can be launched by using the wrapper script {\tt xmlFatThaMat.sh}:
%{\small
%\begin{Verbatim}[frame=leftline]
%./xmlSuperPorker.sh <scenario-file> <base-dir>
%\end{Verbatim}
%}
%where {\tt <scenario-file>} is the scenario configuration file described below and {\tt 
%<base-dir>} is the directory to which the paths of the xml files to be modified in the scenario file are referred. It is essentially the base dir of the CMSSW work area we are using.
%
%
%\subsection{The {\em scenario} configuration file}
%
%An example of the scenario configuration file is given below; it is the scenario file designed to properly change the Aluminium mass in the simulation; in  this case, for example, you want to skip materials that do contain Al (i.e.Alumina!) but that you want to study independently.
%
%{\small
%\begin{Verbatim}[frame=leftline]
%<?xml version="1.0"?>
%<scenario>
%<file name="./Geometry/TrackerCommonData/data/tecmaterial.xml" />
%<file name="./Geometry/TrackerCommonData/data/tibmaterial.xml" />
%<file name="./Geometry/TrackerCommonData/data/tibtidcommonmaterial.xml" />

%<SkipMaterial name="Borosilicate_Glass"/>
%<SkipMaterial name="TEC_PitchAdapter"/>
%</ElementaryMaterial>
%</scenario>
%\end{Verbatim}
%}
%
%Each scenario file tag has its own meaning:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item the tags {\tt <file .../>} define the xml material files to be
%  altered; the material files not included in any tag are not changed;
%%- il tag <path .../> (sopra commentato) definisce un altro eventuale
%%  path comune, oltre a quello definito in linea di comando (base-dir)
%  che debba precedere il path di ciascun file;
%\item there are three possible tags to define the material variations:
%\begin{description}
%  \item[{\tt <ElementaryMaterial ... />}] to modify an elementary
%    material and recursively all composite material that directly or
%    indirectly depend on it; if the attribute {\tt
%      recurse} is given with the option {\tt false} ({\tt
%      recurse=false"}) the recursive modification is not done and the
%    modification is restricted to the pure elementary material only;
%  \item[{\tt <CompositeMaterial ... />}] to modify a composite
%    material and recursively all composite material that directly or 
%    indirectly depend on it; if the attribute {\tt
%      recurse} is given with the option {\tt false} ({\tt
%      recurse=''false"}) the recursive modification is not done and the
%    modification is restricted to the pure composite material only;
%  \item[{\tt <rMaterial ... />}] to modify all composite materials
%    that contain the specified {\tt rMaterial} and recursively all composite material that directly or 
%    indirectly depend on it; in this case the material name must
%    contain the namespace also; this tags is useful in the case a
%    given material needs to be modified but the file containing the
%    material definition is not included in any of the {\tt <file
%      .../>} tags. 
%\end{description}
%For all material modification tags the amount of alteration is
%defined via the attribute {\tt kfactor} ({\tt kfactor="..."}) that quantifies the
%multiplicative factor of the density change.
%
%All material modification tags also accept the following tags for
%extra functionalities:
%\begin{description}
%  \item[{\tt <SkipMaterial ... />}] to specify one or more {\tt CompositeMaterial} 
%  that has to remain unaltered;
%\item[{\tt <OnlyMaterial ... />}] to exclusively specify the {\tt CompositeMaterial} 
%  that has to be altered; if a tag of this kind is present
%  no other modification is done;
%\item[{\tt <SkipNamespace ... />}] to specify one or more namespaces,
%  i.e. files, that has to remain unaltered;
%\end{description}
%\end{itemize}
%
%As an output, the parser produces a modified xml file per each input
%file configured in the {\tt <file ... />} tags. The new file has the
%same name of the original one but the extension {\tt .xml} is changed
%into {\tt .xml.fat}. Within these output files, the modified materials
%are identified by the attribute {\tt fat="true"} in the corresponding
%material definition tags.
%
%\subsection{Helper scripts}
%
%To ease the material modification onto a typical CMSSW working area, two scripts have been written:
%CMSSW work area:
%\begin{description}
%\item[{\tt fat.sh}] (usage: {\tt ./fat.sh <scenario-file> <base-dir>})
%  make the parser modify the material files under the {\tt
%    <base-dir>} according to the given {\tt <scenario-file>}; the
%  original xml files are replaced by the modified ones in order to
%  have a working CMSSW area with the new material files; the old ones
%  are saved with the extension {\tt .xml.orig}; the replacement does
%  not occur in the case original files appear to be already treated by
%  the parser (i.e. the string {\tt fat="true"} is found in the input
%  files); this to avoid to apply material modification in cascade by mistake;
%\item[{\tt defat.sh}] (usage: {\tt ./defat.sh <base-dir>}) restores
%  the original xml files by using the saved versions. 
%\end{description}

\section{The Tracker Recipe}

As a first application of the method, the Tracker
composition in the simulation was evaluated. GEANT4 tools, in fact, 
make easy to dump the total mass and the composition of a logical volume, the entire Tracker for example, but only in terms of
chemical elements. More interesting is the understanding of the composition of 
the Tracker in terms of basic materials, commonly encountered in the construction, e.g.:
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] pure chemical elements, as aluminium, copper, or silicon;
\item[-] simple compounds like alumina (${\rm Al}_2{\rm O}_3$), glass, or metal alloys;
\item[-] more complicated compounds like carbon fiber, FR4 or plastics. 
\end{itemize}
The total mass of the Tracker results from the sum of the mass contributions, i.e.
\begin{equation}
M({\rm Tracker}) = \sum_i m_i = \sum_i \rho_i V_i,
\end{equation}
where $i$ is the index running on the material components and $m_i$,
$\rho_i$ and $V_i$ are, respectively, the mass, the density, and the
volume of the component $i$.

To extract the contribution of a specific material $j$,
the method can be applied with the k-factor different from unity only
for the material under investigation. In this case the resulting total mass
of the entire Tracker logical volume becomes:
\begin{equation}
M_{\vec{k}=(..., 1, k_j, 1, ...)} (\mathrm{Tracker}) = M +
( k_j - 1) m_j.
\end{equation}
It is straightforward to derive the mass of the component $j$: 
\begin{equation}
m_j = \frac{M_{\vec{k}=(..., 1, k_j, 1, ...)} - M}{k_j
  - 1}.
\end{equation}
The procedure, repeated for all the material components, allows the Tracker composition to be derived. 
%The sum of the component masses estimated in this way is equal to the total Tracker mass within 1ppm. The exercise confirms that the method is correctly implemented
It is reported in detail in table~\ref{table:Tracker}: the sum of the component masses derived by this method agrees within 1 ppm with the total Tracker mass as directly given by GEANT4. This exercise is a confirmation that the method is correctly implemented and working.

The compositions of each individual subdetector are reported in the tables of Appendix~\ref{compositionAppendix}.

%\subsection{Material classification in categories}

Although the perl XML parser can deal with each of the 36 basic materials listed in table~\ref{table:Tracker},
for the following analysis these basic materials were grouped into a limited number of {\it categories} defined as a class of homogeneous and/or similar materials. A category can consist of just one basic material.
The category definitions are given in table~\ref{table:cat}.

\begin{table}[h]

The contributions of each of the above categories to the whole Tracker mass are listed in table~\ref{table:TrackerCat} 
and illustrated in the top plot of figure~\ref{fig:summaryMaterials}.

The dependence of $\TX$ and $\TI$ on the single category contribution is the starting point of the systematic study. These dependences are also very important to understand which category dominates the total radiation length and which category is, on the other hand, negligible.The derivation of the dependence of $\TX$ and $\TI$ on the categories is similar to the method described above for the mass fractions.
For example for the thickness in units of radiation length $\TX$, if $k_j$ is the factor different from unity
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{\TX}_{(...,1,{k_j},1...)} = \mathrm{\TX} + (k_j - 1) t_{{\rm R}j},
\end{equation}
from which it is straightforward to derive the respective component $t_{Rj}$:
\begin{equation}
t_{{\rm R}j} = \frac{\mathrm{\TX}_{(...,1,k_j,1...)} - \mathrm{\TX}}{k_j - 1} .
\end{equation}
The contributions of each of the above categories to the $\TX$ and $\TI$, averaged on the overall Tracker volume, 
are illustrated in the middle and bottom plots of figure~\ref{fig:summaryMaterials} respectively.
Figure~\ref{fig:x0Materials} shows the $\eta$ distributions of $\TX$ for the four categories mostly contributing
to the Tracker mass, while the distributions of $\TI$ as a function of $\eta$ for the same categories are shown in figure~\ref{fig:lambda0Materials}.

\section{Determination of the altered scenarios for the Tracker material}

The systematic uncertainties on the representation of the material at the level of GEANT4 simulation can be due several sources, as, for example, the lack of knowledge or approximation in the shape and size of the volumes, chemical compositions and mass. Independently of the source, any effect can be represented to the extent of our needs as an appropriate fractional changes $\nicefrac{\Delta \rho_i}{\rho_i}=k_i-1$ on the material densities, resulting in a variation on the total thickness
\begin{equation}
\Delta \mathrm{T} = \sum_i \frac{\Delta \rho_i}{\rho_i} t_i
\end{equation}
where, again, $\mathrm{T}$ can be $\TX$ or $\TI$ and $t_i$ the respective component determined by means of the method described above.

An insight on the systematic uncertainties on the knowledge of the material can be derived by maximizing or minimizing $\TX$ and $\TI$ with respect to the possible density variations within an allowed domain:
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{\TX} + \Delta \mathrm{\TX} = \sum_i \frac{\ell_i}{X_{0 i}} \left( \rho_i + \Delta \rho_i \right) = \sum_i \tX_i k_i,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{\TI} + \Delta \mathrm{\TI} = \sum_i \frac{\ell_i}{\lambda_{{\mathrm I} i}} \left( \rho_i + \Delta \rho_i \right) = \sum_i \tI_i k_i.
\end{equation}

The aim of the present study is to derive the set of k-factors $\kvect^{\rm R}_{\rm min}$ ({\em minimal $X_0$ scenario}) and $\kvect^{\rm R}_{\rm max}$ ({\em maximal $X_0$ scenario})  corresponding to the minimal and maximal variations $\Delta \TX_{\rm min}$ and $\Delta \TX_{\rm max}$ compatible with the systematic uncertainties. Similar entities can be defined with respect to $\lambda_{\rm I}$:% in place of $X_0$: 
$\kvect^{\rm I}_{\rm min}$ ({\em minimal $\lambda_{\rm I}$ scenario}) and $\kvect^{\rm I}_{\rm max}$ ({\em maximal $\lambda_{\rm I}$ scenario}) corresponding to the minimal and maximal variations $\Delta \TI_{\rm min}$ and $\Delta \TI_{\rm max}$. The variation is defined as the average of $\Delta \TX$ or $\Delta \TI$ over the $\eta$ range comprised between $-3$ and $3$. 

The derivation of the maximal and minimal scenarios results from an extrema finding problem with respect to the variation of material densities intended to represent the effects of the systematic uncertainties. To ease the optimization procedure, the material categories are used in place of the basic materials, much larger in number. The approach is sound since similar materials have been grouped on purpose into homogeneous categories.

The density variation domain results by the imposition of an appropriate set of constraints. These are listed below.
\begin{itemize}
%
% http://indico.cern.ch/getFile.py/access?contribId=6&resId=0&materialId=slides&confId=26422
\item The overall difference between weighted mass and total simulated mass is kept fixed by imposing
 \begin{equation}
\Delta M = \sum_i \frac{\Delta \rho_i}{\rho_i} m_i.
\end{equation}
The Silicon Strip Tracker mass as estimated during the integration and installation is $3996^{+88}_{-132}$ kg. The Pixel detector, installed in a later time, is not included in this estimation. The corresponding mass in the simulation is 4037 kg. The resulting relative weighted versus simulated mass difference is $-1^{+2}_{-3}\%$ suggesting an agreement between weighted and simulated masses within the estimation error.

Similar estimation performed over single subdetector indicate possible localized larger discrepancies. For example, the TIB/TID subdetector plus some ancillary pieces have been weighted. The result is $450^{+12}_{-20}$ kg to be compared with 427.0 kg the simulated mass of the corresponding volumes. The resulting weighted versus simulated mass difference is $5^{+3}_{-4}\%$. As far as the TEC subdetector is concerned an uncertainty of about 3\% is claimed by the experts.

As a consequence, a conservative approach has been chosen in this study: It is assumed that the actual Tracker mass is 5\% larger than the mass on the corresponding volumes in the simulation.

\item The density variation ranges within each category are constrained depending on the characteristic and the typical use of the materials contained in each category. A large amount of direct experience in designing, integrating and assembling the Tracker is used in defining these numbers. They are listed in table~\ref{table:catVariations}.

Composite materials for which the chemical composition can vary substantially and used in shapes with not well defined geometry that can be difficult to represent in the simulation can vary up to $\pm 15\%$; typical examples in this typology are the carbon fiber and the organic materials (i.e. plastics).

Pure materials and metals are typically well known chemically and easier to represent. The cooling fluid C$_6$F$_{14}$ is an exception since its amount is estimated by the internal volume of the pipes that build up the cooling system, often with shapes very complicated. This estimation is difficult.

The category ``Glue and resins'' is assigned with a variation range as large as $\pm 20\%$ because volumes of glues, resins, silicone gel heavily used for assemblying modules and in the integration activity in general were not at all controlled with respect to the amounts used and very dependent of many parameters like temperature.

The density of the sensitive Silicon volume is kept fixed to avoid affecting the signal generated in the active volumes. Nevertheless it is worth noticing that also silicon detector thicknesses can vary up to $\sim 10\%$.

\subsection{The extrema finding problem}

The determination of the k-factors was done with a
standard technique used for solving optimization problems with inequality
constraints, the so-called penalty function method. This method
consists in defining as objective function the sum of the actual
function $f(x)$ to be minimized and a term penalizing the
objective whenever the constraint $g(x)\le 0$ is violated. 
The minimization of the objective function is then performed
iteratively, at every iteration $r$ starting from the value of $x_{r-1}$ found
in the previous step and progressively increasing the penalty term.

Here, the objective functions to be minimized were defined as: 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\TX(\kvect^{\rm R}) = \sum_i k_i t_{{\rm R}j} +
\epsilon^{\rm R}_r \left[ \left(\sum_i (k_i-1.05) \rho_i V_i\right)^2  + \sum_i
  g(k_i)^2 \right] \quad \text{for determining $\kvect^{\rm R}_{\rm min}$,}\\
\TX(\kvect^{\rm R}) = -\sum_i k_i t_{{\rm R}j}, +
\epsilon^{\rm R}_r \left[ \left(\sum_i (k_i-1.05) \rho_i V_i\right)^2  + \sum_i
  g(k_i)^2 \right] \quad \text{for determining $\kvect^{\rm R}_{\rm max}$,}\\
\TI(\kvect^{\rm I}) = \sum_i k_i t_{{\rm I}j} +
\epsilon^{\rm I}_r \left[ \left(\sum_i (k_i-1.05) \rho_i V_i\right)^2  + \sum_i
  g(k_i)^2 \right] \quad \text{for determining $\kvect^{\rm I}_{\rm min}$,}\\
\TI(\kvect^{\rm I}) = -\sum_i k_i t_{{\rm I},} +
\epsilon^{\rm I}_r \left[ \left(\sum_i (k_i-1.05) \rho_i V_i\right)^2  + \sum_i
  g(k_i)^2 \right] \quad \text{for determining $\kvect^{\rm I}_{\rm max}$.}
\end{eqnarray*}

In the above relations, the first term is the thickness to be
minimized, the second term represents the constraint on the change of
the total mass of the Tracker, and the last term the constraint from the
allowed range of variations of the k-factor of the category $i$
defined in table~\ref{table:catVariations}, e.g. $k_{i,min}\le  k_i\le
k_{i,max}$ where the inequalities are defined by the function:
\[
g(k_i)=
\begin{cases}
k_i-k_{i,min}&  \text{if $k_i<k_{i,min}$,} \\
k_{i,max}-k_i,&  \text{if $k_i>k_{i,max}$,} \\
0 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\]
The evolution of the penalty functions are given by 
$\epsilon_r^{\rm R}=2^r$  and $\epsilon_r^{\rm I}=2^{r-1}$, with $r$
being the iteration number, defined to give 
contributions to the objective function of the same order of the
actual function to be minimized during the first iterations. A minimum satisfying the
constraints is reached in about ten iterations.

\label{table:catVariationsMinMax}

\end{table}

The average $\TX$ and $\TI$ for the four extrema scenarios are 
listed in table~\ref{table:catVariationsMinMax} and the fractional
changes of $\TX$ and $\TI$ in the $\eta$  distributions are shown in figures~\ref{fig:x0minmax}
and~\ref{fig:lambda0minmax}. It is worth notice how a global mass change of $+5\%$ can traslate into a local fractional change of $\TX$ and $\TI$ in the range $-3\%$ to $+8\%$ and $-3\%$ to $+10\%$, respectively, and a non trivial $\eta$ dependance.

The four sets of k-factors $\kvect^{\rm R}_{max}$, $\kvect^{\rm R}_{min}$, $\kvect^{\rm I}_{max}$ and $\kvect^{\rm I}_{min}$ can be easily used to configure the parser and produce the four sets of XML files, each corresponding to a specific geometry scenario altered with respect to the default. Each set can be considered representative of the potential systematic uncertainties related to the description of the Tracker material.

The altered geometries can be used to produce Monte Carlo samples and directly estimate the effect of the Tracker material uncertainties on physics analysis selections.
Moreover the approach presented is very flexible, well beyond the four proposed alteration scenarios. In fact, the deployed tools can easily translate into fully working geometry XML files any given alteration found interesting to be studied.

\section{Conclusions}

A method to change in a controlled way the description of the Tracker materials has been set up. The method allows to quantify in $-3\%$ to $+8\%$ and $-3\%$ to $+10\%$ the maximal local variations in terms of $X_0$ and $\lI$, respectively, starting from the realistic assumption of having $5\%$ of the Tracker mass not represented into the simulation. The potential extreme configurations have been translated into working Tracker geometries to be used for Monte Carlo based studies of Tracker material related systematic uncertainties.
