The CMS microstrip Silicon tracker modules consist of one or two
Silicon sensor and a front-end hybrid. A pitch adapter is needed to
accommodate the microstrips' pitch and the readout chips' pitch.
The action of glueing of the pitch adapter onto the hybrid substrate
may result in some damage and the following wire bonding is critical
as a consequence of the large number of channels and their high
density. Afterwords a stringent electrical quality
control is mandatory either to tag major electrical failures, either 
to pin point isolated defective channels. This task has been performed
by a dedicated test-station capable of testing up to four hybrid plus
pitch adapter assemblies in the range beetween room temperature and
-20$^\circ$ to emulate the real running condition during the data
taking. The test procedures, methods and set up are described. Finally
the results obtained over a large number of hybrids are reported.
