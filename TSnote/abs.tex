The modules of the CMS Strip Silicon Tracker consist of one or two
Silicon sensor and a front-end hybrid. A pitch adapter is needed to
accommodate the strips' pitch and the readout chips' pitch.
The action of glueing the pitch adapter onto the hybrid substrate
may result in some damage. The subsequent wire bonding is also critical
due to the large number of channels and their high density. After
these operations a stringent electrical quality control was mandatory
either to tag major electrical failures, either to pin point isolated
defective channels. This task has been performed 
by a dedicated test-station capable of testing up to four hybrid plus
pitch adapter assemblies in the range between room temperature and
$-20\Cdegree$ to emulate the real running condition during the data
taking. The test-station, the methods and the procedures are
described.
