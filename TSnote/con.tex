\section{Conclusions}

The test-station designed at CERN for the test of four hybrids plus
pitch adapter assemblies in the range between room temperature and
$-20\Cdegree$ has been described together with the testing the methods
and procedures.

Two replicas of the test-station have been built and setup, one at
CERN and one in the US. They successfully fullfilled the quality
control test requirements for the ~15000 hybrid plus pitch adapter
assemblies needed for the CMS Silicon Strip tracker.
