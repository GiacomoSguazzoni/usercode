\section{Results}

The hybrid plus PA quality control tests were initially foreseen to be entirely performed at CERN;


While the entire test data have been locally stored, the relevant production and quality control summaries have been sent to the SQL based central tracker database. For this reason the result files are parsed by an XML generator which creates a database compliant XML file. The table TESTWITHPA\_1\_HYB\_ was implemented for the needs of the hybrid test station.

The table TESTWITHPA\_1\_HYB\_ contains the following fields:


Examples of the CERN teststation performances and capabilities are given below; all results refers to hybrid+pa tested at CERN.

A comprehensive review of all hybrids plus PA assembly quality control  performed either at CERN and in the US labs is in preparation.
